			Post-Radical Pedagogy (Nida Abdullah, Xinyi Li, Chris Lee) was convened as a space to explore, antagonize, challenge, and interrogate institutional values and legacies. The program operates as a vehicle to activate pedagogical practice through and against institutional inertia. 
			<br><br>
			“Post” in this context doesn’t denote an “after,” but a consequence of. It prompts a reflection on what happened, where we are because of, or in spite of an inherited (institutional) pedagogical situation that limits radical potentials, and where we go from here. “Post” in this sense is implicitly an acknowledgment of struggle.
			<br><br>

			This year, we’re hosting the Post-Radical Design Pedagogy Lecture Series, exploring the way that white supremacy pervades design pedagogy from institutional policy, curricular language to everyday interactions and technological reliance in the studio.
